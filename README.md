Developed a Youtube app clone using the latest technologies.

Frontend built with React, Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router for navigation, and Tailwind for styling.

Standout feature: Advanced search function with real-time suggestions and debouncing for improved performance. Suggestions are cached in the Redux store for faster retrieval.

Utilized Youtube's APIs to fetch videos and incorporated iframes for video playback.

Supported n-level nested comments using mock data.

Implemented a live chat feature (with mock data) that utilizes API polling for efficient performance.

Older comments are automatically removed to prevent app freezing during extensive chat sessions.

Users can add comments in real-time.
